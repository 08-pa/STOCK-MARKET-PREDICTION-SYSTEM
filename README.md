# STOCK-MARKET-PREDICTION-SYSTEM
#Overview:
Develop a Stock Price Prediction System that utilizes machine learning
techniques to predict the future prices of stocks based on historical data. This
project will involve data collection, preprocessing, model development, training,
evaluation, and deployment. The system will provide an interface for users to
input stock symbols and receive predicted prices along with visualizations of
historical and predicted trends.
Key Features:
1. Data Collection:
- Collect historical stock price data from a reliable financial API (e.g., Alpha
Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
- Fetch data such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close prices.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize or standardize the data for better model performance.
- Create additional features like moving averages, trading volume changes, etc.
3. Model Development:
- Explore various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision
Trees, Random Forest, and more complex models like LSTM (Long Short-Term
Memory) networks.
- Implement feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
4. Model Training and Evaluation:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
- Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error
(MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5. Prediction and Visualization:
- Create a user interface where users can input stock symbols and select the
prediction timeframe.
- Display predicted prices along with confidence intervals.
- Provide visualizations of historical and predicted stock prices using libraries
like Matplotlib or Plotly.
6. Deployment:
- Develop a backend API using Flask or Django to handle prediction requests.
- Create a frontend interface using React.js or a similar framework.
- Deploy the system on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

Tech Stack:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.
- Financial API (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc.).
- Model Development:
- Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models.
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning models (LSTM, etc.).
- Visualization:
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization.
- React.js for interactive frontend visualizations.
- Backend:
- Flask or Django for building the API.
- Frontend:
- React.js for building a responsive and interactive UI.
- Axios for making API requests.
- Deployment:
- Docker for containerization.
- AWS, Heroku, or Azure for cloud deployment.
